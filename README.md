# Katas (kinda)

Inspired by "The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers" (Robert C. Martin Series).

I've started sporadically doing little mini code challenges, starting with the classic bowling problem that was the favorite in that book.

I won't ever get to mastering one problem and repeating it every day.
Iagree with the author of this "[don't do katas](https://simpleprogrammer.com/dont-code-katas/)" article about avoiding that.
Pluss I need my novelty!
I need to be practicing LEARNING, not how to type up a particular solution to a particular problem.

As of 07/21/2024, I've been tackling the bowling score problem in a series of different ways.
Time constraints, different languages, pairing with different people to practice pair programming and TDD.
I plan to continue this practice (sporadically) and with different problems
